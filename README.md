# Os-entire-collection-metadata-update

## Introduction

This script is designed to refresh the metadata of NFTs for a specific Ethereum smart contract. It iterates through all NFTs based on the contract's total supply and refreshes their metadata using the OpenSea API.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- NPM (Node Package Manager)
- An Infura account with an API key for Ethereum mainnet access
- An OpenSea API key

## Installation

Clone the Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/kashn11/OS-entire-collection-metadata-update
cd OS-entire-collection-metadata-update
Install Dependencies: npm install
Set Up Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project. Add the following lines to it:

PORT=5000
INFURA_API_KEY=[Your Infura API Key]
OS_API_KEY=[Your OpenSea API Key]
contract_Address=[Your contract Address]
Usage
Set the Contract ABI:
Place the ABI JSON file in the root directory and name it abi.json.

Run the Script:
npm start
```

## Troubleshooting

TypeError: contract.totalSupply is not a function:
Ensure that your ABI file correctly represents the contract and that totalSupply is a function in your smart contract.

## Rate Limit Errors:

If you encounter rate limit errors from Infura or OpenSea, consider increasing the delay in the script or implementing a more sophisticated rate limiting strategy.

## Network Mismatch:

Ensure that the Infura endpoint you are using matches the network of your smart contract.

## Contributing

Contributions to the script are welcome. Please ensure to follow the coding standards and submit a pull request for review.
